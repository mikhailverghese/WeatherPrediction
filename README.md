# WeatherPrediction
Predicting whether it will rain based on real Australian Weather Data

Original dataset retreived from Kaggle 'https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package' stored as WeatherAUS.csv

I then cleaned this data into a new dataset and saved it as preprocessed_data.csv

My base python program is stored under a python notebook file called weather_prediction.ipynb which includes all code used for cleaning
and machine learning implementation on data.
